## Greetings! 
Riffen here. A brief glimpse into my lack of using "_Hello World_" term.

<!-- Avoiding formalities would be linked to the fact of being present on the internet since the beginning of the 2000's; where young me was already rummaging and snooping around in places that I had no idea would be my future years later.
Curiosity is intrinsic. Magic happens when there is pure and legitimate interest.
As a matter of fact: nerds like me were here the whole time. Several internet spaces and services in my country, in their first widespread forms, were my safe haven.

However, a younger approach to digital intricacies can be misunderstood by white-collar men's eyes. As a true artist must express himself freely, a designer must have that spirit when developing something for himself and the world.

>I am currently working on a number of personal projects for various purposes. In the section just below there is something about my projects.

**Note:** All this text will soon be moved to my future blog, where I will write to anyone interested in reading something in this context.

## Projects

*Ideas and ideas. For now they're kind of a short-term dream...*

### Approach

These ideas are relatively new, I'm working on drafts little by little; to go beyond exercises of learning techniques that I trained throughout classes in curricular disciplines.

Many fellow students are concerned about writing super complex programs, or with fancy features. Some want to invent a revolutionary app, integrating everything that exists with everything and aaaargh. "Calm down young dude. You can worry about it after your graduation, when you get paid for it". Where are the young people who just wanted to catalog pokemons by elements?

## Navigation Portal
this will be the most interesting visually. It will have something to do with the multiverse pop culture sci-fi theme, as it will be the splash page to navigate between all these pages. Oh boy. I'm so excited to do this one!

## Personal Blog:
Something very casual, nothing too awesome. A space for me to pretend I'm a journalist, critic, philosopher, sometimes testing my writing skills, random philosophies about technology, politics and science. Something like a box of memories for very few who might be interested. Maybe myself from the future?

## "Heap of aesthetics"
It might not have a very groovy name, but it might be the most interesting one. It will aim to bring together pop culture interests, music, comics, science fiction, memes, maybe a dash of humor, something more aimed at young entertainment.

## Portfolio
 I'd prefer to call it a small experiment laboratory, but I have questionable taste in naming things, so I'll stick with the more obvious. This would be to house those small interesting projects, or small features, some component of a library. Something along these lines.

Of course, I will never be satisfied with my curriculum, not now. For now I'm looking to promote my studies and show something nice. My current moment is one of discovery and learning, so everything here is a big idea for me to work on over the course of months, maybe years.

    Feel free to send me a message! 
    I love talking to random strangers,
    especially if you're a tech recruiter.
